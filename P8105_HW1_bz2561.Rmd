# Problem 1
```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```


The dataset shows hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013. There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` variables in this dataset, which are `r colnames(early_january_weather)`. There are `r ncol(early_january_weather)` data points in the data. Besides, the average temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)` F.

```{r}
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, 
                                         color = humid)) + geom_point()
```
