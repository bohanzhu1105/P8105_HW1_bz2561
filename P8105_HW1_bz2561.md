## Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset shows hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for
the month of January 2013.  
There are 15 variables in this dataset, which are origin, year, month,
day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour.  
`origin` represents the weather station. `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`
represents the time of recording. `temp` and `dewp` represents
temperature and dewpoint in F. `humid` means relative humidity.
`wind_dr`, `wind_speed`, and `wind_gust` shows wind direction (in
degrees), speed, and gust speed (in mph). `precip` indicates
precipitation, in inches. `presure` calculates sea level pressure in
millibars. `visib` shows visibility in miles, and lastely `time_hour`
represents the date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.  
There are 358 data points in the data.  
Besides, the average temperature is 39.5821229 F.

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, 
           color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
```

From the scatter plot, we observe a clear upward trend in temperature
over the first two weeks of January, with noticeable daily fluctuations.
Despite these short-term variations, the overall pattern indicates
steady warming. The humidity color scale does not reveal a strict
pattern, as both high and low humidity values appear in the early and
later periods. However, lower humidity tends to cluster around lower
temperatures, while higher humidity is more frequently associated with
higher temperatures.

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot_weather.pdf",height = 4,width = 6)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(123)
df1 =
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = (ifelse(vec_numeric > 0, TRUE, FALSE)),
    vec_character = c("Math","Finance","Music","Art","Statistics","Physics",
                      "Marketing","Biology","Accounting","Literature"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("STEM","Business","Humanities","Humanities","STEM","STEM",
                   "Business","STEM","Business","Humanities"))
  )

df1
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_character vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>         <fct>     
    ##  1     -0.560  FALSE       Math          STEM      
    ##  2     -0.230  FALSE       Finance       Business  
    ##  3      1.56   TRUE        Music         Humanities
    ##  4      0.0705 TRUE        Art           Humanities
    ##  5      0.129  TRUE        Statistics    STEM      
    ##  6      1.72   TRUE        Physics       STEM      
    ##  7      0.461  TRUE        Marketing     Business  
    ##  8     -1.27   FALSE       Biology       STEM      
    ##  9     -0.687  FALSE       Accounting    Business  
    ## 10     -0.446  FALSE       Literature    Humanities

We can see that we can take the mean for numerical variable and logical
variable. We can not take the mean for character variable or factor
variable.

``` r
mean(pull(df1, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.07462564

``` r
mean(pull(df1, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df1, vec_character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df1, vec_character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df1, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df1, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When we apply as.numeric, we can see that logical vector becomes 0,1
now. 0 represents FALSE and 1 represents TRUE. Hence, is possible to
transfer a logical variable to a numerical variable. This is the reason
why we may take the mean of a logcial variable.  
For character variable, transforming the variable to numeircal variable
results NAs. That is reasonable because character can be anything.  
Finally, for factor vairable, we can see that data now becomes 1 or 2 or
3 because we assign three levels to the data. Here 1 means Business, 2
means Humanities, and 3 means STEM. However, taking the mean for factor
variable doesn’t have any practical meaning.

``` r
logic_trans = as.numeric((pull(df1, vec_logical)))
character_trans = as.numeric((pull(df1, vec_character)))
factor_trans = as.numeric((pull(df1, vec_factor)))
```
